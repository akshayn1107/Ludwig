-- MkRegEx --

This is a regular expression engine with support for tracing and extracting
matches. It uses an NFA-based algorithm. It's not 100% ready for easy use,
as RegEx's must be manually constructed using constructor functions.


-- MkDOTParser --

(* The DOT parser will return an edge sequence.
 *  S is the sequence structure to use.
 *  V is the element structure to use for the vertex type. *)

structure Parser = MkDOTParser (structure S = ArraySequence
                                structure Vx = IntElt
                                structure Wt = RealElt)

Parser.parse "graph test {1--2 3--4}"
Parser.parseFile "parsers/test.dot"
